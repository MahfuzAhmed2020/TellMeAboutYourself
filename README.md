# ♣ Hi this is MD MAHFUZ  and I  am having around 7+ years of experience into IT and it’s totally into QA. But last 5-6 years I am   majorly involved into automation activity .I started my career as  an automation tester after working my first project I involved into  automation testing and it was very interesting to me. Majorly I am doing  70-80% automation testing and 20-30% into manual               testing in all phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). 

♣ I am a quick learner,  self motivated and I work as a team member and I am very friendly with my Co-workers. My goal is to build a    successful career as a Software Tester, which can help my company and me personally. My strengths are my positive attitude,  punctuality, interpersonal skills and strong in management skills. I am a good team player and goal oriented. 

♣ In my career I worked as a manual and automation tester across various domains such as Telecom, Insurance, and E-commerce  mostly for web based applications where I performed front end and back end testing by developing test scenarios, test cases, test data, test strategy, test plans, test reports (based on acceptance criteria, and Wireframe), and also created automation test scripts  using Selenium WebDriver API  with Java.  
 
♣I have a very good knowledge on  4 fundamentals like Abstraction,Inheritence,Encapsulation and Polimorphism  of Object Oriented   Programming (OOP) Language  JAVA.   

♣I performed different types of testing like Smoke Testing, Sanity Testing, Regression Testing, Integration Testing, and Database  Testing etc.  

♣ Doing that I mostly worked in Agile methodology in both Scrum and Kanban projects.In my current company, we are following Agile  methodology.In Agile process We do various activities like sprint planing ,daily standup meeting , Backlog refinement,Demo  meeting   and Retrospective meeting .


♣ As a tester my main responsibility is to find the bug and raise it into the bug reporting tools, like JIRA/Rally and to provide end-to-end solutions to software quality problems to ensure that software runs smoothly as expected and meets client needs.

♣ In addition, I write test cases into Excel sheet or Jira by using Zypher add in and execute them manually or using automation tools like selenium WebDriver API, in different servers or environments like QA, Prepod and Production.

♣ As an automation engineer, I have experience in writing and analyzing different kinds of documentations and attending different Agile meetings whether they are an onshore or offshore team.

♣Furthermore, I mostly used selenium WebDriver API for functional UI testing for web based applications. To enhance my selenium  scripts, I used Object Oriented Programming Language Java.

♣In my career, I had a chance to work with different testing frameworks like Data Driven, Keyword Driven, Hybrid, BDD Cucumber etc.    where I mostly used Maven as a project building tool and I used junit, and testNG as a testing framework.In POMXML I added all the   dependencies I need. Even though I am pretty  much comfortable with building framework from the scratch , but I am good at working    with e xisting framework as well and my  strongest debugging skills help me to do this.

♣To share our project within team members I got chance to work with different version control tools like Git and Bitbucket.

♣To run our  regression suite nightly bases we would trigger our project into JENKINS as a CI/CD tool.

♣Sometimes I performed PARALLEL and CROSS BROWSING testing using Selenium Grid and Sauce Lab.For reporting purposes, I  used LOG4J for debugging and generating logs and Extend Reports for customized HTML report.

♣I have a good experience to find the XPATH for finding the WebElements.

♣For the failed test cases to take the screen shot I use ITestListener interface.

♣I have a good understanding with BDD (Behavior Driven Development) Framework where I write Cucumber Feature File using Gherkin Syntax like (Feature, Background, Scenario, Scenario Outline, Given, And, When, Then, and Example) and I implemented  them using Page Object Model concept through Step Definition class and executed tests using Runner class configuring with Cucumber   Options such as feature, glue, format, dryRun etc.

♣Even though I am expert in UI Testing, I have hands on experience for back end testing as well.

♣To validate Database I used SQL  queries with multiple Databases such as MS SQL, MySQL and Oracle. 

♣I have good knowledge in API testing manually like Rest and Soap using Postman and SoapUI tools. Besides that, I execute Rest API  using automation tools like Rest Assured framework.

♣Other than all of my automation experiences, I have a good understanding with web fundamentals concepts like HTML,   CSS,  Javascript, Ajax, Angular Javascript, and web based document sharing platform Microsoft SharePoint etc.

♣In short, that is all about myself.
   If you would like to know anything specifically, i’ll be more than happy to elaborate.
