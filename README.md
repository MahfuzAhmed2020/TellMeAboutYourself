# ♣ Hi this is MD MAHFUZ  and I  am having around 7+ years of experience into IT and it’s totally into QA. But last 5-6 years I am   majorly involved into automation activity .I started my career as  an automation tester after working my first project I involved into  automation testing and it was very interesting to me. Majorly I am doing  70-80% automation testing and 20-30% into manual testing in all phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).
